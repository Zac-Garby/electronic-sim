## About
Electronic Simulation (I haven't thought of a good name yet) is a basic web-based
simulation of not-quite electronics.

By default, there are 20+ components:

 - Sources
 - Oscillators
 - Random Sources
 - Wires
 - Diodes
 - Wireless transmitters/receivers
 - Lights
 - Micro-controllers
 - Logic gates
 - Etc..

## Getting started:
Run the following commands (You'll need to install NodeJS beforehand):

```
git clone https://github.com/Zac-Garby/electronic-sim
cd electronic-sim
npm install
npm start
```

## TODO:
 - Clean code up a bit
 - Organise CSS into separate files
 - Add help page
 - Change favicon
 - Make component-list groups drop-downs
 - Add testing
