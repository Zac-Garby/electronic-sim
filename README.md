## Getting started:
Run the following commands (You'll need to install NodeJS beforehand):

```
git clone https://github.com/Zac-Garby/electronic-sim
cd electronic-sim
npm install
npm start
```

Or, you can just go to [this url](https://zac-garby.github.io/electronic-sim/)
to try it out instantly, however it won't necessarily be completely up to date,
as I only update it every 15 commits or so.

## TODO:
